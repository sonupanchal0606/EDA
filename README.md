## The Data Analysis Process
Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.
1) Asking the right question
   - What Features will contribute to my analysis ?
   - What Features are not important to my analysis ?
   - Which of the features have strong correlation with target variable?
   - Do I need data Pre Pocessesing ?
   - What kind of feature manipulation/engineering is required ?
3) Data Wrangling/ Data Munging / Data Preprocessing
   - Data Gathering
     - CSV
     - API
     - Web Scraping
     - Database
   - Assessing the data
     - Cleaning the data
     - Missing data (eg Mean)
     - Remove Duplicate Data (drop_duplicates)
     - Incorrect Datatypes (astype)
5) EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
   - Univariate Analysis
   - Bivariate Analysis
   - Multi variate Analysis
   - EDA using Pandas Profiler 
7) Drawing Conclusions
8) Communicating the results
